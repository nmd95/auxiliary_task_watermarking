shift to transfer learning. Models like ELMo, fast.ai's ULMFiT, Transformer and OpenAI's GPT have allowed researchers to achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks and provided the community with large pre-trained models with high performance. This shift in NLP is seen as NLP's ImageNet moment, a shift in computer vision a few year ago when lower layers of deep learning networks with million of parameters trained on a specific task can be reused and fine-tuned for other tasks, rather than training new networks from scratch.\n","\n","One of the most biggest milestones in the evolution of NLP recently is the release of Google's BERT, which is described as the beginning of a new era in NLP. In this notebook I'll use the HuggingFace's `transformers` library to fine-tune pretrained BERT model for a classification task. Then I will compare the BERT's performance  with a baseline model, in which I use a TF-IDF vectorizer and a Naive Bayes classifier. The `transformers` library help us quickly and efficiently fine-tune the state-of-the-art BERT model and yield an accuracy rate **10%** higher than the baseline model.\n","\n","**Reference**:\n","\n","To understand **Transformer** (the architecture which BERT is built on) and learn how to implement BERT, I highly recommend reading the following sources:\n","\n","- [The Illustrated BERT, ELMo, and co.](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-bert/): A very clear and well-written guide to understand BERT.\n","- [The documentation of the `transformers` library](https://huggingface.co/transformers/v2.2.0/index.html)\n","- [BERT Fine-Tuning Tutorial with PyTorch](http://mccormickml.com/2019/07/22/BERT-fine-tuning/) by [Chris McCormick](http://mccormickml.com/): A very detailed tutorial showing how to use BERT with the HuggingFace PyTorch library.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"slO_rmYgwmmE"},"source":["# B - Setup"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"D-Ly3C2n8z3y","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1625669238644,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":407,"user":{"displayName":"Barak Levy","photoUrl":"","userId":"11917179774666865192"}},"outputId":"498aaf98-7a93-41c7-f452-dfa626843313"},"source":["%cd /content/drive/MyDrive/amnlp_project_round_2"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["/content/drive/MyDrive/amnlp_project_round_2\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"31OW0dhozvli"},"source":["## 1.
